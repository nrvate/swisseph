# Defects still present in upstream Swiss Ephemeris

Bugs found and fixed in a thread-safety fork of Swiss Ephemeris, **each one
verified still present in upstream** at `3fd0f95` ("with -astorb"), the
`legacy-master` this fork branched from. Line numbers below are upstream's.

This is not a diff of the fork. Most of what the fork changed — explicit
contexts, a C17 build, a strict ephemeris policy — is a deliberate
divergence upstream has no reason to want. What follows is only the subset
that is a defect in upstream's own terms: memory errors, crashes, and
answers that depend on what was computed before them.

**Severity** is about what a caller sees, not how hard it was to find:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Memory** | out-of-bounds read or write, or use of uninitialised memory |
| **Crash** | reachable null dereference |
| **Correctness** | a wrong number returned from a public function |
| **Robustness** | a crash or silent truncation on malformed input |

Each entry gives upstream's file and line, what a caller has to do to reach
it, and the shape of the fix. Where the fork's fix is quoted, it has been
reduced to the part that matters — the fork's version also carries a `ctx`
parameter that upstream has no equivalent for, and that is not part of the
bug.

**How these were found.** Almost none came from reading code looking for
defects. They came from asking why a particular function had low or zero
test coverage, and then building a test that reached it. Several of the
worst were in code that had never executed even once.

## 1. `find_conjunct_sun()` indexes a 18-entry table with an asteroid number

**Severity: Memory (out-of-bounds read, far out of bounds)**
**Where:** `swehel.c:2586`, table at `swehel.c:2566`

```c
static const double tcon[] = {
  0, 0,
  2451550, 2451550,  /* Moon */
  ...
  2451568, 2451753,  /* Neptune */
};                                        /* 18 elements */

static int32 find_conjunct_sun(double tjd_start, int32 ipl, int32 helflag,
                               int32 TypeEvent, double *tjd, char *serr)
{
  ...
  i = (TypeEvent - 1) / 2 + ipl * 2;
  tjd0 = tcon[i];                          /* swehel.c:2587 -- unbounded */
```

`tcon[]` tabulates two conjunction epochs each for the Sun through Neptune
and stops there. `ipl` reaches this function from `DeterObject()`
(`swehel.c:305`), whose final branch is:

```c
  if ((ipl = atoi(s)) > 0) {
    ipl += SE_AST_OFFSET;                  /* SE_AST_OFFSET is 10000 */
    return ipl;
  }
```

So a numeric object name produces `ipl >= 10000`, and the index becomes
`ipl * 2` — around **20000 into an 18-element array**. This is not an
off-by-one; it reads roughly 160 KB past the table into whatever the linker
placed next, and segfaults as soon as that address is not mapped.

**Reproducer**

```c
    double dret[50], dgeo[3] = {16.4, 48.2, 190}, datm[4] = {1013.25, 15, 40, 0};
    double dobs[6] = {36, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
    char serr[256];
    swe_set_ephe_path("/path/to/ephe");
    /* "433" is Eros; any numeric name reaches the same index */
    swe_heliacal_ut(2451545.0, dgeo, datm, dobs, "433",
                    SE_HELIACAL_RISING, SEFLG_SWIEPH, dret, serr);
```

The value read becomes `tjd0`, the seed epoch for the conjunction search, so
even when the address happens to be mapped the function iterates from a
number that means nothing.

**Fix.** There is no tabulated conjunction epoch for these bodies, so the
honest answer is a refusal rather than a search seeded from garbage:

```c
  i = (TypeEvent - 1) / 2 + ipl * 2;
  if (ipl < 0 || i < 0 || (size_t) i >= sizeof(tcon) / sizeof(tcon[0])) {
    if (serr != NULL)
      snprintf(serr, AS_MAXCH,
               "heliacal events are not available for object no. %d: "
               "no conjunction epoch is tabulated for it\n", (int) ipl);
    return ERR;
  }
  tjd0 = tcon[i];
```

---

## 2. `heliacal_ut_arc_vis()` gives `swe_azalt()` a 2-element array to write 3 doubles into

**Severity: Memory (stack write, 8 bytes past the end, four call sites)**
**Where:** `swehel.c:2215`, written at `swehel.c:2302, 2318, 2329, 2347`

```c
static int32 heliacal_ut_arc_vis(double JDNDaysUTStart, ...)
{
  ...
  double xaz[2];                           /* swehel.c:2215 */
  ...
    swe_azalt(tret, SE_EQU2HOR, dgeo, Pressure, Temperature, xin, xaz);
```

`swe_azalt()` writes three doubles to its output array — azimuth, true
altitude, and apparent altitude (`swecl.c`, in `swe_azalt`):

```c
  xaz[0] = 360 - x[0];
  xaz[1] = x[1];		/* true height */
  xaz[2] = swe_refrac_extended(x[1], ...);
```

so every one of the four calls writes eight bytes past the end of a stack
array. What that corrupts depends on the compiler's frame layout; with a
stack protector it is a clean abort, without one it is silent.

Two other functions in the same file declare `xaz[3]` for the same call,
which is what makes this look like a typo rather than a design.

**Reproducer.** Any `swe_heliacal_ut()` call that reaches the arcus-visionis
strategy — the default for a planet:

```c
    swe_heliacal_ut(2451545.0, dgeo, datm, dobs, "venus",
                    SE_HELIACAL_RISING, SEFLG_SWIEPH, dret, serr);
```

Build with `-fsanitize=address` to see it reported rather than tolerated.

**Fix.** `double xaz[3];`

---

## 3. `swe_heliacal_ut()` copies uninitialised stack memory to the caller

**Severity: Memory (uninitialised read, then an unbounded copy into the caller's buffer)**
**Where:** `swehel.c`, in `swe_heliacal_ut()` — declaration and the Moon branch

```c
  char ObjectName[AS_MAXCH], serr[AS_MAXCH], s[AS_MAXCH];   /* uninitialised */
  ...
    tjd = tjd0;
    retval = MoonEventJDut(tjd, dgeo, datm, dobs, TypeEvent, helflag, dret, serr);
    while (retval != -2 && *dret < tjd0) {
      tjd += 15;
      *serr = '\0';                       /* only inside the loop */
      retval = MoonEventJDut(tjd, dgeo, datm, dobs, TypeEvent, helflag, dret, serr);
    }
    if (serr_ret != NULL && *serr != '\0')
      strcpy(serr_ret, serr);             /* reads serr, which may never have been written */
    return retval;
```

`serr` is a local with no initialiser. The only unconditional write to it is
`*serr = '\0'` **inside** the `while` loop, which does not run when the first
`MoonEventJDut()` call already returns an acceptable date. And
`MoonEventJDut()` does not initialise it either — it forwards to
`moon_event_arc_vis()` or `moon_event_vis_lim()`, and neither writes `serr`
except on an error path.

So on the ordinary success path `*serr` is read uninitialised. If that byte
happens to be non-zero, `strcpy()` then copies stack garbage into the
caller's buffer and keeps going until it finds a zero — which is not
guaranteed to be within `AS_MAXCH`, so this can also overflow whatever the
caller passed.

The same pattern appears at the end of the function for the non-Moon path,
but there the loop above it always executes at least once, so that read is
safe today. It is safe by accident of control flow rather than by design.

**Reproducer**

```c
    char serr[256];
    double dret[50], dgeo[3] = {16.4, 48.2, 190}, datm[4] = {1013.25, 15, 40, 0};
    double dobs[6] = {36, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
    swe_heliacal_ut(2451545.0, dgeo, datm, dobs, "moon",
                    SE_HELIACAL_RISING, SEFLG_SWIEPH, dret, serr);
```

Under MemorySanitizer this reports a use of uninitialised value at the
`*serr` test. Under ASan it is invisible — reading uninitialised stack is not
an ASan finding — which is part of why it survived.

**Fix.** Initialise at the declaration:

```c
  char ObjectName[AS_MAXCH], serr[AS_MAXCH] = "", s[AS_MAXCH];
```

Initialising the buffer is preferable to adding `*serr = '\0'` before the
first call, because the same function has two more sites with the same shape
and one fix covers all of them.

---

## 4. `swe_set_jpl_file()` after a JPL Horizons calculation makes the next one segfault

**Severity: Crash (null dereference, reachable from ordinary setup calls)**
**Where:** free at `sweph.c:1268`, guard at `sweph.c:1387`, dereference at `swephlib.c:2091`

`load_dpsi_deps()` loads the IERS dpsi/deps corrections once and remembers
that it did:

```c
void load_dpsi_deps(void)
{
  ...
  if (swed.eop_dpsi_loaded > 0)
    return;                                   /* sweph.c:1387 -- load once */
  ...
  swed.dpsi = calloc(SWE_DATA_DPSI_DEPS, sizeof(double));
  swed.deps = calloc(SWE_DATA_DPSI_DEPS, sizeof(double));
```

`swi_close_keep_topo_etc()` frees both arrays and nulls the pointers, but
**does not reset `eop_dpsi_loaded`**:

```c
  if (swed.dpsi != NULL) {
    free(swed.dpsi);
    swed.dpsi = NULL;                         /* sweph.c:1270 */
  }
  if (swed.deps != NULL) {
    free(swed.deps);
    swed.deps = NULL;
  }
  /* eop_dpsi_loaded still says "loaded" */
```

So the next Horizons request reloads nothing, and `calc_nutation()` hands the
null pointer straight to `bessel()`:

```c
      dpsi = bessel(swed.dpsi, n + 1, J2 - swed.eop_tjd_beg);   /* swephlib.c:2091 */
```

whose first statement dereferences it:

```c
static double bessel(double *v, int n, double t)
{
  ...
  if (t <= 0) {
    ans = v[0];                               /* swephlib.c:2008 */
```

**What makes this easy to hit.** The function that frees the arrays is not
some teardown path — it is called by exactly two public functions, and both
are ordinary setup:

```
  swe_set_ephe_path()   sweph.c:1323
  swe_set_jpl_file()    sweph.c:1481
```

`swe_set_jpl_file()` is *required* to reach Horizons mode in the first place
— without it, `plaus_iflag()` downgrades `SEFLG_JPLHOR` to
`SEFLG_JPLHOR_APPROX` and says so. So any program that names a JPL file,
computes, then names another one — or simply re-points the ephemeris path —
crashes on its next Horizons calculation.

**Reproducer.** Needs a JPL file with DE ≥ 403 (e.g. `de431.eph`) and
`eop_1962_today.txt` present, which is what Horizons mode requires anyway:

```c
    double xx[6]; char serr[256];
    swe_set_ephe_path("/path/with/de431.eph/and/eop");
    swe_set_jpl_file("de431.eph");
    swe_calc(2451550.5, SE_MARS, SEFLG_JPLEPH | SEFLG_JPLHOR, xx, serr);
    swe_set_jpl_file("de431.eph");                 /* frees dpsi/deps */
    swe_calc(2451550.5, SE_MARS, SEFLG_JPLEPH | SEFLG_JPLHOR, xx, serr);  /* SEGV */
```

**Fix.** Put the flag back with the arrays it describes:

```c
  if (swed.dpsi != NULL) {
    free(swed.dpsi);
    swed.dpsi = NULL;
  }
  if (swed.deps != NULL) {
    free(swed.deps);
    swed.deps = NULL;
  }
  swed.eop_dpsi_loaded = 0;
```

**Why it was never seen.** `bessel()` is only reachable through
`SEFLG_JPLHOR`, which needs a JPL ephemeris of DE ≥ 403 *and* the IERS
corrections. Neither ships with the source, so the function had never
executed at all — it measured 0.00% coverage — and the first time it ran, it
crashed.

---

## 5. A `SEFLG_JPLHOR` request contaminates every later calculation at the same instant

**Severity: Correctness (wrong results from unrelated calls, up to ~0.9 arcsec in obliquity)**
**Where:** `sweph.c`, `swi_check_ecliptic()` and `swi_check_nutation()`

Both the obliquity and the nutation are cached per epoch:

```c
void swi_check_ecliptic(double tjd, int32 iflag)
{
  ...
  if (swed.oec.teps != tjd || tjd == 0) {
    calc_epsilon(tjd, iflag, &swed.oec);      /* recompute only if the EPOCH differs */
  }
}

void swi_check_nutation(double tjd, int32 iflag)
{
  ...
  if (!(iflag & SEFLG_NONUT)
	&& (tjd != swed.nut.tnut || tjd == 0
	|| (!speedf1 && speedf2))) {          /* epoch, plus the SPEED bit only */
```

But both cached values **depend on flags the key omits**. `calc_epsilon()`
forwards `iflag` to `swi_epsiln()`, and both it and `calc_nutation()` branch
on the Horizons flags:

```c
double swi_epsiln(double J, int32 iflag)
  ...
  if (iflag & SEFLG_JPLHOR)
  if ((iflag & SEFLG_JPLHOR_APPROX) && jplhora_model == SEMOD_JPLHORA_3)
```

The `SEFLG_JPLHOR_APPROX` branch adds the JPL Horizons offset to the
obliquity. Measured at −3000 that is **0.88 arcsec**. So once a Horizons
request has computed the obliquity for an instant, every later request about
**the same instant** is served that value — whatever flags it asked for.

Worse, it reaches callers that were explicitly excluded from Horizons mode.
`plaus_iflag()` strips `SEFLG_JPLHOR`/`_APPROX` for the nodes and apogees:

```c
  if (ipl == SE_OSCU_APOG || ipl == SE_TRUE_NODE
      || ipl == SE_MEAN_APOG || ipl == SE_MEAN_NODE
      || ipl == SE_INTP_APOG || ipl == SE_INTP_PERG)
    iflag = iflag & ~(SEFLG_JPLHOR | SEFLG_JPLHOR_APPROX);
```

and they still get the Horizons obliquity, because the cache does not know
the difference.

**Scale.** Over 10 bodies × 4 epochs × 3 flag sets, **104 of 120 answers
changed** when a Horizons request preceded them. The prior request does not
even have to succeed: with no JPL file present it still resolves the flags
and fills the caches before the file open fails.

**Reproducer**

```c
    double a[6], b[6], junk[6]; char serr[256];
    swe_set_ephe_path(path);
    swe_calc(1356173.5, SE_MEAN_NODE, SEFLG_SWIEPH, a, serr);

    swe_close(); swe_set_ephe_path(path);
    swe_calc(1356173.5, SE_MARS, SEFLG_JPLEPH | SEFLG_JPLHOR, junk, serr);
    swe_calc(1356173.5, SE_MEAN_NODE, SEFLG_SWIEPH, b, serr);

    /* a[0] != b[0] -- the node moved because Mars was asked about first */
```

**Fix.** Put the flags the value depends on into the key. Only two bits
matter, since those are the only ones `swi_epsiln()` and `calc_nutation()`
consult:

```c
#define SWI_JPLHOR_FLAGMASK (SEFLG_JPLHOR | SEFLG_JPLHOR_APPROX)

/* struct epsilon gains: int32 epsflag; */

static void calc_epsilon(double tjd, int32 iflag, struct epsilon *e)
{
    e->teps = tjd;
    e->epsflag = iflag & SWI_JPLHOR_FLAGMASK;
    ...
}

/* and in swi_check_ecliptic() */
  if (swed.oec.teps != tjd || tjd == 0
      || swed.oec.epsflag != (iflag & SWI_JPLHOR_FLAGMASK)) {
    calc_epsilon(tjd, iflag, &swed.oec);
  }
/* likewise for oec2000, and copy epsflag through the tjd == J2000 branch */

/* and in swi_check_nutation(), adding to the existing condition */
	|| (nutflag & SWI_JPLHOR_FLAGMASK) != (iflag & SWI_JPLHOR_FLAGMASK)
```

There is precedent for this one level down: `calc_nutation()` already
declines its own memo for exactly these two flags, because its result depends
on them. This is the same argument applied to the enclosing cache.

After the change the same measurement gives **0 of 120**.

---

## 6. `swe_calc_pctr()` returns a different answer depending on what was computed before it

**Severity: Correctness (up to 24.5 arcsec)**
**Where:** `sweph.c:8042`, `swe_calc_pctr()`

The function transforms to the ecliptic of date using the shared obliquity
and nutation caches:

```c
    oe = &swed.oec;                    /* or &swed.oec2000 under SEFLG_J2000 */
    ...
    swi_coortrf2(xx, xx, oe->seps, oe->ceps);
    swi_coortrf2(xx, xx, swed.nut.snut, swed.nut.cnut);
```

but it never calls `swi_check_ecliptic()` or `swi_check_nutation()` for its
own `tjd` — **not once in the whole function**. Every other site that reads
those caches keys them first: `swecalc()`, `app_pos_etc_plan()`,
`swi_fixstar_calc_from_record()` all do.

Instead it relies on a side effect of the call at the top:

```c
  /* this fills in obliquity and nutation values in swed */
  swe_calc(tjd + swe_deltat_ex(tjd, epheflag, serr), SE_ECL_NUT, iflag, xx, serr);
```

That is already the wrong epoch — `tjd` is ET, so adding delta-t overshoots —
but the real problem is what comes next. **Four more `swe_calc()` calls run
between there and the transformation**, and each one re-keys the caches to
its own epoch:

```c
  retc = swe_calc(tjd, iplctr, iflag2, xxctr, serr);
  retc = swe_calc(tjd, ipl,    iflag2, xx,    serr);
  ...
    retc = swe_calc(t, iplctr, iflag2, xxctr2, serr);   /* t = tjd - light time */
    retc = swe_calc(t, ipl,    iflag2, xx,     serr);
```

so the transformation ends up using whatever the last of them happened to
leave — which depends on the caller's history, not on the arguments.

**Measured.** Asking for Mars from Jupiter at J2000, after computing one
other position first:

| the previous position's epoch | error |
|---|---|
| +1 day | 0.02 arcsec |
| +100 days | 1.89 arcsec |
| +1000 days | 2.94 arcsec |
| +10000 days | **24.5 arcsec** |

`swe_calc()` itself is stable under the same sequence — only
`swe_calc_pctr()` moves.

**Reproducer**

```c
    double x[6]; char serr[256];
    swe_set_ephe_path(path);
    swe_calc_pctr(2451545.0, SE_MARS, SE_JUPITER, SEFLG_SWIEPH, x, serr);
    double first = x[0];
    swe_calc(2451545.0 + 10000.0, SE_MARS, SEFLG_SWIEPH | SEFLG_SPEED, x, serr);
    swe_calc_pctr(2451545.0, SE_MARS, SE_JUPITER, SEFLG_SWIEPH, x, serr);
    /* x[0] differs from `first` by ~24.5 arcsec */
```

**Fix.** Key the caches to the epoch being transformed to, immediately before
using them — the two calls every other site makes:

```c
  swi_check_ecliptic(tjd, iflag);
  swi_check_nutation(tjd, iflag);
  if (!(iflag & SEFLG_J2000)) {
    swi_precess(xx, tjd, iflag, J2000_TO_J);
    ...
```

**Independent check that this is the right direction.** Planetocentric
coordinates taken from the Earth must equal ordinary geocentric ones. That
identity holds better after the fix for every body tested:

| body | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Mars | 3.92e-06″ | 1.10e-06″ |
| Jupiter | 1.93e-06″ | 1.25e-06″ |
| Venus | 4.90e-07″ | 3.45e-07″ |
| Saturn | 4.28e-06″ | 2.19e-06″ |

This is worth checking against an independent reference before adopting: it
is a real improvement in an invariant the library must satisfy, but the
remaining residual shows the identity is not exact either way.

## 7. `swe_get_astro_models()` lets a caller's argument decide how much it writes into the caller's buffer

**Severity: Memory (buffer overflow, reachable from a command-line argument)**
**Where:** `swephlib.c:4493`; the exposed caller is `swetest.c:802/1089/1331`

The function echoes `samod` — the **caller's** string — into `sdet`, the
caller's buffer, with a bare `sprintf`:

```c
      sprintf(sdet + strlen(sdet),
              "For list of all available astronomical models, add a '+' to the version string\n"
              "(swetest parameter -amod%s+ or -amod%s+)\n", samod, samod0);
```

Nothing bounds `%s`, and the API documents no size for `sdet`, so no buffer
the caller provides can be safe.

`swetest` supplies both halves of the problem:

```c
static char smod[2000];                       /* swetest.c:802 */
...
    } else if (strncmp(argv[i], "-amod",5) == 0) {
      astro_models = argv[i] + 5;             /* swetest.c:1089 -- straight into argv */
...
    swe_get_astro_models(astro_models, smod, iflag);   /* swetest.c:1331 */
```

**Reproducer**

```sh
    swetest -edir/path/to/ephe -amod$(python3 -c 'print("M"*2000)') -p0 -b1.1.2000
```

Under ASan: `global-buffer-overflow`, `WRITE of size 2133`. Without a
sanitizer it silently corrupts whatever follows `smod` in BSS.

**A second, quieter problem in the same function.** A `'+'` in `samod` makes
it enumerate every model, which writes about **1914 bytes** — into
`swetest`'s 2000. That leaves 86 bytes of headroom with no argument involved
at all, so adding one more model, or lengthening one description, overflows
it on its own.

**Fix.** Two parts, and the first is what makes the second possible:

1. Bound the echo, so the library's output no longer depends on the caller's
   input length:

```c
      sprintf(sdet + strlen(sdet),
              "...(swetest parameter -amod%.60s+ or -amod%.60s+)\n", samod, samod0);
```

   60 is well past anything meaningful — `set_astro_models()` reads a short
   digit list, and the `"SE2.06"` form is truncated to 20 characters before
   it is parsed.

2. Then document the buffer size at the prototype and give `swetest` real
   headroom, since the enumeration alone needs ~1.9 KB:

```c
/* sdet: a '+' in samod lists every model -- ~1.9 KB today, growing with each
 * one added. Give it 4000. */
ext_def(void) swe_get_astro_models(char *samod, char *sdet, int32 iflag);
```

## 8. The JPL reader trusts the file's own size fields against fixed arrays

**Severity: Memory (two overflows, both driven by values read from the file)**
**Where:** `swejpl.c:108–109` (the arrays), `swejpl.c:807` and `swejpl.c:~487` (the writes)

Two fixed buffers are filled to sizes the ephemeris file chooses:

```c
  double buf[1500];                             /* swejpl.c:108 */
  double pc[18], vc[18], ac[18], jc[18];        /* swejpl.c:109 */
```

**(a) `ncoeffs` against `buf[1500]`.** `ksize` is computed from `eh_ipt[]`,
which is read from the file header, then:

```c
    ncoeffs = ksize / 2;                        /* swejpl.c:674 */
    ...
    for (k = 1; k <= ncoeffs; ++k) {
      if (fread((void *) &buf[k - 1], sizeof(double), 1, js->jplfptr) != 1) {   /* :807 */
```

Nothing checks `ncoeffs <= 1500`. A file whose header implies more simply
writes past `buf` into the rest of the `jpl_save` structure — `pc`, `vc`,
`ac`, `jc` and `do_km` all follow it.

Note this is not only a malformed-file concern: real ephemerides sit close
to the limit, and the code carries hard-coded `ksize` values up to 2036 for
DE403/405/410/413/414/418/421.

**(b) `ncf` against `pc[18]`.** `ipt[i*3+1]` is the per-body coefficient
count, also straight from the file, and `interp()` uses it to index the
Chebyshev work arrays:

```c
  int ncf = (int) ncfin;
  ...
  if (np < ncf) {
    for (i = np; i < ncf; ++i)
      pc[i] = twot * pc[i - 1] - pc[i - 2];     /* pc is double pc[18] */
```

A file claiming more than 18 overflows `pc`, and then `vc`, `ac`, `jc` in
turn, since they are adjacent members.

**Fix.** Bound both against the arrays, and tie the array size to the bound
so the two cannot drift apart later:

```c
/* fsizer() rejects any ksize outside [1000, 5000]; ncoeffs is ksize/2, so
 * this is that bound restated as a coefficient count. */
#define JPL_NCOEFF_MAX 2500

  double buf[JPL_NCOEFF_MAX];

static_assert(sizeof(((struct jpl_save *) 0)->buf)
            / sizeof(((struct jpl_save *) 0)->buf[0]) == JPL_NCOEFF_MAX,
    "buf[] must hold exactly JPL_NCOEFF_MAX doubles");
```

and reject an implausible per-body count when the header is parsed, rather
than corrupting memory on the first `interp()` call:

```c
    for (i = 0; i < 13; ++i) {
      if (ipt[i * 3 + 1] > (int32) (sizeof(js->pc) / sizeof(js->pc[0]))) {
        if (serr != NULL)
          sprintf(serr, "JPL ephemeris file has an invalid coefficient count (%d) for body %d",
                  (int) ipt[i * 3 + 1], i);
        return NOT_AVAILABLE;
      }
    }
```

The `static_assert` matters more than it looks: the original `buf[1500]`
was too small for a legal `ksize` at the upper end of the range the reader
itself accepts, and nothing connected the two numbers.

---

## 9. `sprintf(serr, "…%s…", <caller string>)` overflows the caller's buffer

**Severity: Memory (buffer overflow into a caller-provided buffer)**
**Where:** ~37 sites across `sweph.c`, `swemplan.c`, `swehel.c`, `swecl.c`, `swejpl.c`, `swephlib.c`

`serr` is documented as `char[AS_MAXCH]`, and `AS_MAXCH` is **256**
(`sweodef.h:261`). Many error paths format a variable-length string into it
with a bare `sprintf` and no precision, so the caller's buffer overflows
whenever that string is long enough.

The cleanest example takes the string straight from the caller:

```c
/* swecl.c:1648, and identically at swecl.c:2456 */
      sprintf(serr, "occultation never occurs: star %s has ecl. lat. %.1f",
              starname, ls[1]);
```

`starname` is the `char *starname` parameter of `swe_lun_occult_when_glob()`
/ `swe_lun_occult_when_loc()`. The fixed text is about 45 characters, so a
star name beyond roughly 205 characters writes past the end of whatever the
caller passed as `serr`.

**Reproducer**

```c
    char serr[256];                      /* AS_MAXCH, as documented */
    char star[400];
    double tret[10], attr[20];
    memset(star, 'A', sizeof star - 1); star[sizeof star - 1] = '\0';
    swe_set_ephe_path(path);
    swe_lun_occult_when_glob(2451545.0, SE_MOON, star, SEFLG_SWIEPH, 0,
                             tret, 0, serr);
```

Others take the string from a file path or a filename rather than the caller
— still unbounded, just less directly controlled:

```c
/* swejpl.c:232 */
	sprintf(serr, "alleged ephemeris file (%s) has invalid format.", js->jplfname);
/* swejpl.c:758 */
	  sprintf(serr, "JPL ephemeris file %s is mutilated; length = %d instead of %d.",
	          js->jplfname, ...);
/* sweph.c:7575 */
      sprintf(serr, "star %s not found", star);
```

**Fix.** `snprintf` with the destination size, and a precision on each `%s`
so the variable part cannot crowd out the fixed text:

```c
      snprintf(serr, AS_MAXCH,
               "occultation never occurs: star %.180s has ecl. lat. %.1f",
               starname, ls[1]);
```

Two things worth knowing if you take this on, both learned the hard way:

- **Size the precisions so the worst case fits.** Converting the sites but
  leaving a precision too generous (`%.230s` in a message with 30 characters
  of fixed text) still overruns — and `-Werror=format-truncation` only
  reports it in some optimisation modes, so a build can look clean and fail
  elsewhere.
- **Watch the escapes when editing in bulk.** A mechanical sweep across these
  sites is easy to get subtly wrong: `"\\n"` written where `"\n"` was meant
  produces a literal backslash-n in the message, which no test notices.

## 10. Changing the precession or nutation model does not invalidate the cached obliquity

**Severity: Correctness (the old model's values keep being returned)**
**Where:** `swephlib.c`, `swe_set_astro_models()`; `sweph.c`, `swe_set_sid_mode()`

`swed.oec` (obliquity) and `swed.nut` (nutation) are cached and keyed on the
epoch alone — see entry 5. Their *values* also depend on which model is
selected, through `swed.astro_models[]`:

```c
double swi_epsiln(double J, int32 iflag)
{
  ...
  int prec_model = swed.astro_models[SE_MODEL_PREC_LONGTERM];
```

But `swe_set_astro_models()`, which changes exactly those settings,
invalidates **nothing** — no reference to `swed.oec`, `swed.nut`, `teps`,
`tnut` or `swi_force_app_pos_etc()` appears anywhere in it.

`swe_set_sid_mode()` is close but not sufficient: it calls
`swi_force_app_pos_etc()`, which clears the saved planet positions —

```c
    swed.pldat[i].xflgs = -1;
    swed.nddat[i].xflgs = -1;
```

— and leaves the obliquity and nutation caches untouched.

So: compute a position, change the precession model, ask again about **the
same instant**, and the answer is still built on the old model's obliquity,
because the cache sees a matching epoch and returns.

**Reproducer**

```c
    double x1[6], x2[6]; char serr[256], sam[64];
    swe_set_ephe_path(path);
    swe_calc(1356173.5, SE_MARS, SEFLG_SWIEPH, x1, serr);   /* caches oec at this epoch */
    strcpy(sam, "0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0");                          /* switch precession model */
    swe_set_astro_models(sam, 0);
    swe_calc(1356173.5, SE_MARS, SEFLG_SWIEPH, x2, serr);   /* still the old obliquity */
```

Use a distant epoch — near J2000 most models take the same short-term branch
and agree, which is part of why this is easy to miss.

**Fix.** Give the setters an invalidation step. The minimum is to void the
epoch keys so the next request recomputes:

```c
static void swi_invalidate_models(void)
{
  swed.nut.tnut     = 0;
  swed.nutv.tnut    = 0;
  swed.oec.teps     = 0;
  swed.oec2000.teps = 0;
  swi_force_app_pos_etc();
}
```

called from `swe_set_astro_models()` and from `swe_set_sid_mode()`.

This is the same defect family as entries 5 and 6: a cache whose key omits
something its value depends on. Entry 5 is the flags, this one is the model
settings, entry 6 is a caller that never keys the cache at all. Fixing any
one of them does not address the others.

---

## 11. Changing the ephemeris path does not re-read the files that were loaded from it

**Severity: Correctness (a new ephemeris directory is silently ignored)**
**Where:** `swedate.c:87/319` (`init_leapseconds_done`), `swephlib.c:3098` (`init_dt_done`)

Two tables are loaded once from files found along `swed.ephepath`, each
behind a load-once flag:

```c
/* swedate.c:87 */
static TLS AS_BOOL init_leapseconds_done = FALSE;
...
/* swedate.c:319 -- init_leapsec() */
  if (!init_leapseconds_done) {
    init_leapseconds_done = TRUE;
    ...
    if ((fp = swi_fopen(-1, "seleapsec.txt", swed.ephepath, NULL)) == NULL)
```

```c
/* swephlib.c:3098 -- init_dt() */
if (!swed.init_dt_done) {
  swed.init_dt_done = TRUE;
```

`swe_set_ephe_path()` calls `swi_close_keep_topo_etc()`, which is where
path-derived state is dropped — it closes the ephemeris files, the JPL file
and the star file. **Neither flag is reset there**, and
`init_leapseconds_done` could not be reset from `sweph.c` anyway, being a
file-scope static in `swedate.c`.

So after the first use, the leap-second table and the delta-t table are
frozen to whichever directory happened to be current, and a later
`swe_set_ephe_path()` to a directory with its own `seleapsec.txt` or
`swe_deltat.txt` has no effect on them.

**Reproducer**

```c
    /* dirA/seleapsec.txt lists a leap second at 2026-12-31
       dirB/seleapsec.txt lists one at 2030-12-31 instead */
    double dret[2]; char serr[256];
    swe_set_ephe_path("dirA");
    swe_utc_to_jd(2026,12,31,23,59,60.0, SE_GREG_CAL, dret, serr);   /* accepted */
    swe_set_ephe_path("dirB");
    swe_utc_to_jd(2030,12,31,23,59,60.0, SE_GREG_CAL, dret, serr);   /* REFUSED  */
    swe_utc_to_jd(2026,12,31,23,59,60.0, SE_GREG_CAL, dret, serr);   /* still accepted */
```

A UTC time of `23:59:60` is valid only on a day the table lists, so whether
it is accepted is a direct read-out of which file is in force.

**Fix.** Reset both when the path changes. `init_dt_done` lives in `swed`
and can be cleared directly in `swi_close_keep_topo_etc()`; the leap-second
flag needs a small reset function exported from `swedate.c`, since it is a
file-scope static there:

```c
/* swedate.c */
void swi_reset_leapsec(void) { init_leapseconds_done = FALSE; }

/* sweph.c, in swi_close_keep_topo_etc(), beside the other path-derived state */
  swed.init_dt_done = FALSE;
  swi_reset_leapsec();
```

`init_dt()` re-seeds its table from the built-in values when it runs again,
so the flag is all that has to go back.

**Honest scope.** The leap-second half has the reproducer above. The delta-t
half is the same flag pattern in the same close path, and is fixed by the
same one-line reset, but I did not manage to build a reproducer that shows
it changing an answer — treat that half as fixed by inspection.

---

## 12. `setest/` — five defects in the test harness upstream ships

**Severity: Memory / Robustness** — none of these affect the library, but
they weaken the tool used to validate it. The leak in particular makes the
harness useless for finding leaks anywhere else.

**(a) A leak on every check that PASSES.** `check_s()` copies the actual
value onto the heap *before* comparing it (`checkpoints.c`):

```c
    const typed_value act = { .value.s = copy_string(field),
                              .on_heap = true,
                              .type = S };
    entry exp = get_entry( name, S, ctx );
```

but `clear_failures() -> st_free()` only frees copies that reached a
`failure`. Every passing string comparison loses one — **4153 bytes in 1038
allocations** in a single `setest t` run, which is all of the harness's
leakage. Fix: take the copy inside the branch that stores it, as
`check_equals_s_internal()` already does.

**(b) `is_blank()` returns false for every input** (`globals.c:86`):

```c
bool is_blank(const char *s) {
  for (const char *s1 = s;s1 != '\0';s1++) if (!isspace(*s1)) return false;
```

`s1 != '\0'` compares the **pointer** against the null pointer constant, so
the walk ends only at the terminator — where `isspace()` fails and the
function returns false. `-Wpointer-compare` names it; setest builds with
`-Wall` alone, and that warning needs `-Wextra`. Fix: `*s1 != '\0'`, and cast
to `unsigned char` for `isspace()` since these files are UTF-8.

**(c) `ends_with()` reads before the buffer** (`globals.c:47`):

```c
bool ends_with(const char *string, const char * sub) {
  const int len = strlen(string);
  const char* sub_start = string + len - strlen(sub);
  for (const char *p = string+len-1; p>=sub_start; p--) {
```

With `strlen(string) < strlen(sub)`, `sub_start` points before the buffer.
It is data-dependent — the loop returns at the first mismatch, so it only
runs off the front when the tail matches — but ASan confirms it for
`ends_with("x", ".fix")`. The caller then does
`test_collection[strlen(name)-4] = '\0'`, a write at `[-3]`, if the
comparison spuriously succeeds. Fix: `if (strlen(sub) > len) return false;`

**(d) Unbounded `strcpy` from `argv`** (`setest.c:182`):

```c
           strcpy(ctx->test_collection,argv[optind]);
```

into `char test_collection[SETEST_MAX_SYMBOL_SIZE]` — 50 bytes — in the
middle of `test_context`. A longer name overwrites every member after it and
dies later somewhere unrelated; ASan cannot see it, because the overflow
stays inside one object. Three sites then build `"<name>.exp"` in another
`char[50]`, overflowing that by up to four more. Fix: refuse a name that does
not fit, rather than truncate — a truncated name reads someone else's
expectations.

**(e) SIGFPE on a malformed fixture** (`multivalues.c:126`):

```c
      default:
        fprintf(stderr,"Could not parse multivalue expression '%s'\n",p0);
        return;                      /* the function is void */
```

The caller never learns, the table stays at length 0, and
`multivalues_get_next()` evaluates

```c
    mv->i = ( mv-> i + 1 ) % mv->length;    /* multivalues.c:31 */
```

— integer division by zero, core dumped, with the real cause already
scrolled past. The `double` version of the same parser has the mirror bug:
it exits on the parse failure but *returns* on `!ok`, silently running a
smaller test set. Fix: both unrecoverable paths should exit, as the
surrounding code already does in the other half of each pair.

---

## 13. Lower severity, grouped

**`degstr()` formats into a 20-byte static** — `swephgen4.c:171`

```c
  static char a[20];	/* must survive call */
  ...
  sprintf (a, "%c%3d %2d'%5.2f\"", sign, ideg, imin, sec);
```

`%3d` is a minimum width, not a maximum. For an in-range angle the result is
about 14 characters and fits; for a degree value with more than three digits
it does not. This is in a generator utility rather than the library, and
needs out-of-range input to bite, so it is a hardening item rather than a
live defect. `snprintf(a, sizeof a, ...)` is enough.

**Bare column offsets in the IERS and astorb parsers.** The finals and
astorb readers slice fixed-width records with numeric literals at the call
site. Nothing is out of bounds today, but the widths are stated nowhere and
a format change would be silent. Naming the offsets costs nothing and makes
the next format revision reviewable.

---

## How these were found

Almost none of this came from reading code looking for defects. The method
was:

1. **Measure coverage across every test binary, not just one.** Several
   files look far worse from a single run than they are, and — more
   importantly — the functions at genuine zero are where the defects were.
2. **Ask why a specific number is low, then build a test that reaches it.**
   Entries 1, 2, 4 and 5 were all in code that had never executed. Entry 4
   crashed on its first ever execution.
3. **Run the result under sanitizers.** ASan found entries 1, 2, 7 and the
   setest ones. Entry 3 is invisible to ASan — reading uninitialised stack is
   not an ASan finding — and needs MSan or an explicit initialiser.
4. **Test the invariants, not the expectations.** Entries 5, 6, 10 and 11 are
   all "the same question, asked twice, answered differently". No reference
   ephemeris can adjudicate that; asking the same question in two orders can.

Point 4 matters most for anyone reproducing this. Upstream's own `t.exp`
fixture cannot settle these, because it is a *recording of upstream's
output* — its header names the machine, the user and the date it was
generated. Agreeing with it means behaving like the version that produced
it, bugs included.

## Suggested order

If only some of this is worth taking:

| Priority | Entries | Why |
|---|---|---|
| First | 4 | a crash, reachable from ordinary setup calls |
| | 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 | memory errors, several caller-triggerable |
| Then | 5, 6, 10, 11 | wrong answers that depend on call order |
| Last | 12, 13 | test harness and utilities |

Entries 5, 6 and 10 are one family — a cache whose key omits something its
value depends on. Fixing one does not address the others, and it is worth
auditing the remaining caches on the same question: *what does this value
depend on, and is all of it in the key?*

## Caveats

- Line numbers are upstream `3fd0f95`. The mechanisms are stable but the
  numbers will drift.
- Every entry was verified present in that tree by reading it, and every
  reproducer was run against a build of this fork with the fix reverted.
- The fixes shown are the shape that worked here, reduced to what upstream
  needs. They are not upstream patches — this fork carries an explicit
  context parameter that upstream has no equivalent for.
- Entries 5, 6, 10 and 11 change numerical output. That is the point of
  them, but it means they need a deliberate decision about regression
  fixtures rather than a silent adoption.
